        <p class="problem-text">
            Nice to meet you, Yupechika-san. I am Takada Rio. Here is my first question. What led you to create Satoko and Nada?
            <br><br>
            In my college days, I studied in the US and met several students who were <span class="blank">(1)</span>. At that time, I knew very little about Islam. The <span class="blank">(1)</span> lifestyle surprised me, but I learned a lot. I wanted to share this <span class="blank">(2)</span> with many people, so I created the manga and posted on social media.
            <br><br>
            <span class="blank">(3)</span>, I was shocked by the story “Personality Gap”. Before reading the story, I had the wrong <span class="blank">(4)</span> about <span class="blank">(1)</span> women. I had <span class="blank">(5, think)</span> they were <span class="blank">(6)</span> people <span class="blank">(7)</span> their faces and bodies with dark cloths. <span class="blank">(8)</span> at all-girls’ <span class="blank">(9)</span>, they show their faces and wear and were colorful dresses.
            <br><br>
            That is a big surprise, isn’t it? In Satoko and Nada, there are many stories <span class="blank">(10)</span> with culture shock.
            <br><br>
            Before I read your manga, I felt sorry for <span class="blank">(1)</span> women because they couldn’t choose their clothes.
            <br><br>
            Well, in the beginning, I felt same way. But I now know it’s not true. We should not <span class="blank">(11)</span> people before knowing about their culture.

        <h2>5-2 問題</h2>
        <p class="problem-text">
            Was there anything you kept in <span class="blank">(1)</span> while <span class="blank">(2, write)</span> Satoko and Nada?
            <br><br>
            When I was creating the stories, I tried to <span class="blank">(3)</span> <span class="blank">(4)</span> of “Muslim girls” and “Japanese girls”. <span class="blank">(5)</span>, I tried to describe Satoko and Nada as <span class="blank">(6)</span>.
            <br><br>
            Could you explain that in a little more detail?
            <br><br>
            Sure. For example, we may feel <span class="blank">(7)</span> when we hear someone say “In <span class="blank">(8)</span>, all Japanese are...”. When we meet people from another culture, we should see them not as <span class="blank">(9)</span> but as <span class="blank">(6)</span>. In the story “Knowing You”, Satoko says to Nada, “I mean, I do wanna know more about your culture, but I <span class="blank">(10)</span> just wanna know more about you.” Satoko wants to know more about her roommate, Nada, and <span class="blank">(11)</span>, she also wants to know more about Nada’s culture. This, I think, is the starting point of <span class="blank">(12)</span>-<span class="blank">(13)</span> communication.
